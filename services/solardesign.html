        <h2>Residential Drawings</h2>
        <p>Teams at PremiumCAD have extensive experience and knowledge in designing Residential Solar Permit Plans. We work with our customers to provide 
            end-to-end solution for their <b>residential PV plan</b> requirements starting right from Proposal creation to <b>Permit Set</b> creation, <b>Engineering Review</b> 
            and <b>As-Built</b> creation.
        </p>
        <h3>Proposal Drawings</h3>
        <p>
            Proposal Drawing are one of the initiations point and are very critical. We have large teams who have extensive knowledge of various industry standards 
            and guidelines used by various States/AHJs and are capable of turning around the proposals at a very fast pace. We are platform agnostic and are open 
            and swift to adapt any existing workflows which may be interacting with your sales teams.
            <br>
            For large proposal requirements, we even setup dedicated workforce who work in sync with your sales team and provide almost real-time support while you 
            are out selling. Typical turnaround times for proposals are 12 Hrs.
            <br>
            Our teams are experienced with creating Proposal Drawings with most optimum solar production proposals with just having an address and any specific 
            client requirements.
        </p>
        <h3>Permit Plan Set</h3>
        <p>
            Residential Solar Permit Plan Sets or Construction drawings are another critical component of the process. We understand and ensure that the permit 
            sets created are precise, accurate, complete and clean/aesthetically pleasing for the installation team to understand and install solar panels in the 
            field as per plan.
            <br>
            Our teams are well aware of National Electric Codes (NEC) and other applicable codes for various AHJs and Home Owner Association (HOA) requirements. 
            We are pretty swift in adapting codes changes and any custom requirements from customer, installer and/or EPCs.
            <br>
            Designers at PremiumCAD are well conversant and acquainted with requirements and design specifications for different type of installations and 
            Interconnections:
            <ul>
                <li>Flush Mounts installation</li>
                <li>Tilt Roof Mount</li>
                <li>Non-Penetrating Roof Mount</li>
                <li>Ballast</li>
                <li>Ground Mount Installations</li>
                <li>Microinverters</li>
                <li>On-Grid / Off-Grid</li>
                <li>Hybrid</li>
                <li>Battery Backups</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            While we are open to adapt to customer templates and design specification to ensure that you and your team do not see a change in their ongoing process, 
            we have our own comprehensive templates as well. These templates are customized to use blocks and data tables to ensure consistency and accuracy in data 
            and design.
            <br>
            Our typical Residential Solar Permit Plan Set includes the following; however, these are customizable and adaptable to any specific need:

                </li>
                <li>Specification Sheets
                    <ul>
                        <li>Solar Modules</li>
                        <li>Inverters</li>
                        <li>Racking</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Typical inputs required for completion of a permit plan are home owner details, equipment details including module, inverter, racking system and attachment 
            details, an approved layout or any guidelines on required system size, structural details, photos along with site measurements of roof (in case site 
            measurements are not available, these are designed based on google/nearmap images, as may be available) and details and photos of existing electrical 
            equipment and locations.
            <br>
            Availability of the above information ensures accurate and efficient system design in the first-go and early AHJ acceptances.
        </p>
        <h3>As-Built Drawings</h3>
        <p>
            While the permit set design is done to best of available information including measurements and obstruction locations, sometime however, variations are 
            observed in field and the installation team has to deviate/accommodate the actual field situation. This at times result in change of layout, 
            interconnection used or other parameters.
            <br>
            As_Builts are generally required for the record of Home owners to keep a copy of the final installation plan and at times required by AHJs before proving 
            Permit to Operate (PTO).
            <br>
            We would only require the change information, may be marked on the initial plan or a sketch of changes to make the As-Builts and deliver them on priority.
        </p>
        <h3>Revisions/Changes</h3>
        <p>
            We at PremiumCAD do acknowledge the fact that there are instances when the created Plan set require changes and address such change/revision requests 
            on priority and ensure that the required changes with complete impact analysis are implemented in the first go itself and thus maintaining the overall 
            turn-around time. The changes may occur due to change in racking system, mounting plans or layout, electrical equipment or any specific requirement from 
            AHJ and our teams are able to handle all very swiftly.
