        <h1>Telecom Services</h1>
        <p>At PremiumCAD, we have been working with various Solar Installers and contractors for over a decade, providing them end-to-end solution for Solar 
            PremiumCAD has a long standing experience in supporting the global telecommunications industry through different types of services. One of these involves the update of wireless telecom construction drawings. Wireless telecom towers would need to be upgraded or modified based on the changes in mobile telecom technology. These changes in the tower infrastructure should also be professionally reported and updated in the telecom operator’s records as well. Hence in order to identify and update such changes, and to verify the tower’s capacity, availability of space etc., a ground survey team visits the premises of each telecom tower to collect and digitally record the on-site information. Based on these records, photographs and other survey inputs, each tower information is updated, thereby enabling the decision support systems of the telecom operator.
