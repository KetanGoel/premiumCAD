                    <li><b>Expertise:</b> Solar design companies have the expertise and experience to design a solar system that meets your specific needs and budget. 
                        They can also help you navigate the complex process of getting solar permits and financing.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Peace of mind:</b> Knowing that your solar system was designed by a professional can give you peace of mind. A solar design company will 
                        take care of all the details, so you can focus on enjoying your savings.

                    <li><b>Guarantees:</b> Many solar design companies offer guarantees on their work. This means that you can be confident that your solar system 
                        will perform as expected.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Your time:</b> If you don't have the time or expertise to design your own solar system, hiring a professional is the best option.

                </ul>
                <br>
